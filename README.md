# Google Summer of Code

> Resources for the [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] program.

Hello! And welcome to stdlib's [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC) resource repository.

GSoC is a global program that offers new contributors (who are **18** years or older) an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period. Contributors are paid by Google to work under the guidance of mentors from an open source community. GSoC is a great opportunity to learn, develop new skills, build connections, acquire experience working with a larger and often distributed team, and be financially compensated for your efforts. 

In this repository, you'll find information on how to apply for GSoC and a list of potential ideas which could serve as the basis for a GSoC project.

## Application Process

In order to apply to GSoC with stdlib, you must:

1. Read the resources in this repository in full.
2. Visit the main [project repository][stdlib] and familiarize yourself with the source code, project organization, and general conventions.
3. Consult the project [issue tracker][stdlib-issues] to find ongoing stdlib discussions.
4. Read through the project [contributing guide] to learn how to start developing stdlib.
5. Read and understand the [Code of Conduct][stdlib-code-of-conduct]
5. Create a [GitHub account][github-create-account], if you do not already have one.
6. Develop your application TODO

## Time Commitment

GSoC contributors are [expected][gsoc-faq-time-commitment] to work either **350** hours (full-time equivalent) or **175** hours (part-time equivalent) over the course of the program. The default schedule runs over 3 months (12 weeks) and can potentially be spread out over a longer period.

The program start date is [**non-negotiable**][gsoc-faq-schedule-start]. All GSoC contributors **must** begin the program at the same time.
