# Google Summer of Code

> Resources for the [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] program.

Hello! And welcome to stdlib's [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC) resource repository.

GSoC is a global program that offers new contributors (who are **18** years or older) an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period. Contributors are paid by Google to work under the guidance of mentors from an open source community. GSoC is a great opportunity to learn, develop new skills, build connections, acquire experience working with a larger and often distributed team, and be financially compensated for your efforts. 

In this repository, you'll find information on how to apply for GSoC and a list of potential ideas which could serve as the basis for a GSoC project.

## Application Process

In order to apply to GSoC with [stdlib][stdlib], you must:

1. Read the resources in **this** repository in full.
1. Visit the main [stdlib project repository][stdlib] and familiarize yourself with the source code, project organization, and general conventions.
1. Read and understand the [Code of Conduct][stdlib-code-of-conduct].
1. Consult the project [issue tracker][stdlib-issues] to find ongoing [stdlib][stdlib-issues] discussions.
1. Read through the project [contributing guide][stdlib-contributing] to learn how to start developing [stdlib][stdlib].
1. Create a [GitHub account][github-create-account], if you do not already have one.
1. Submit **at least** one patch to [stdlib][stdlib]. All applications which are not accompanied by at least one patch to stdlib will be **rejected**. Instructions as to how to fulfill the [patch requirement](#patch-requirement) are described below.
1. Review our [list of ideas][stdlib-gsoc-ideas] to see if you find a project which excites you. If you'd like to submit your own idea, that is fine; just be sure to propose your idea to stdlib mentors first! **Unsolicited, undiscussed ideas are less likely to get accepted.**
1. Develop your application, making sure to follow the [application template][stdlib-gsoc-application-template]. We strongly suggest opening an [issue][stdlib-gsoc-application-template] which describes your project using the [application issue template][stdlib-gsoc-application-template]. Doing so allows individuals who are not on the [GSoC website][gsoc] to review your application and provide feedback.
1. **The application deadline is April 4, 18:00 UTC.** You are **strongly** advised to submit your application well in advance of the deadline. Google will **not** accept late applications for any reason. You will be able to edit your application up until the deadline, so, if you have a draft, submit it early and continue to update it as time allows.

Please remember that all applications **must** go through Google's application system and you **MUST SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION ON GOOGLE'S WEBSITE**. If you do not submit your application on the [GSoC website][gsoc], we **cannot** accept your application.

>**Tip**: Communication is probably the most important part of the application process. Talk to mentors and other stdlib developers, **listen** when they offer advice, and demonstrate that you've understood their suggestions by incorporating their feedback into what you are proposing. Failure to incorporate feedback **significantly** lowers your chance of success.

If you have questions, first check whether the questions have already been answered in the GSoC [FAQ][gsoc-faq]. If you still have a question after consulting the GSoC [FAQ][gsoc-faq], you can reach out on the stdlib [Gitter][stdlib-gitter] channel.

You can use [Gitter][stdlib-gitter] to solicit feedback on initial project ideas and to get help as you start working with the [stdlib][stdlib] codebase. Keep in mind that the more specific and clear your questions on stdlib forums, the more likely you are to get a good answer. An open-ended or vague question is unlikely to get a useful response.

For example, a good question could be something along the lines of

> I'm interested in project X, and I've done a bit of research and found that issues Y and Z seem related. Based on my findings, a, b, and c are already implemented, so I'd like to know whether it would be reasonable to propose a project that would achieve d, e, and f.

In contrast, the following question is too open-ended and too vague to solicit a meaningful response

> I'm interested in project X. Please help me to work on this.

When reaching out over [Gitter][stdlib-gitter], be sure to introduce yourself so that we can get to know you. Some useful pieces of information include

- Level of familiarity with JavaScript (including years of programming and previous projects).
- Education level (high school / college / PhD).
- Any particular expertise (e.g., statistics, numerical algorithms).
- Any particular interests (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing, asynchronous JavaScript, user interface design, etc).
- Familiarity with [stdlib][stdlib] (e.g., have you used [stdlib][stdlib]?).
- Other possibly relevant information (e.g., geographical location, native language, etc).

### Patch Requirement



## Time Commitment

GSoC contributors are [expected][gsoc-faq-time-commitment] to work either **350** hours (full-time equivalent) or **175** hours (part-time equivalent) over the course of the program. The default schedule runs over 3 months (12 weeks) and can potentially be spread out over a longer period.

The program start date is [**non-negotiable**][gsoc-faq-schedule-start]. All GSoC contributors **must** begin the program at the same time.
