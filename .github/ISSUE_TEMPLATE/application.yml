        Thanks for taking the time to complete this application!

        A few general notes:

        1.  To be considered, a GSoC application **must** have a written proposal submitted to <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>. The purpose of creating this issue is to allow stdlib mentors to provide feedback and answer any questions you have regarding your prospective project proposal. Note, however, that we will **not** write your proposal for you. You, and you alone, are responsible for writing, and the timely submission of, your project proposal.

        1.  Please use a succinct name to describe your proposal. This issue should use the following issue naming convention:

            -   RFC: the succinct name describing your proposal

            For example,

            -   RFC: improve tiling algorithms for element-wise ndarray iteration
            -   RFC: build a developer dashboard for tracking repository build status

        1.  In your proposal, you should include the following information, as described below.

        ## You and your project

        Tell us about your proposal!

        When detailing the project schedule, you are advised to note where along the way where you could formulate a pull request. Ideally, pull requests should be points where you can have self-contained, well-documented, and tested pieces of functionality. Breaking the project into smaller sub-tasks which can be completed as part of one or more pull requests helps to keep branch merges and code reviews reasonable. A large code dump at the end of the program will likely be hard to review and merge before the project deadline.

        Please do **not** copy verbatim text from the list of project ideas or from other people's discussions about your project. Always write your proposal in your own words.

        If you include any significant text or code from another source in your application, you must properly cite the included material. All papers or references that you use or plan to use must be cited. Place all citations in a "References" section at the bottom of each appliable application section. Copying text without citation is plagarism and will result in your application being rejected.
